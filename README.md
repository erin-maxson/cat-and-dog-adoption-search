# <Cat-and-Dog-Adoption-Search-Engine>

## Description

This application was created to help a user find local dogs and cats that are available for adoption. By using the Petfinder API and adding in some fun pet facts APIs, we wanted to provide an easy way to search for local adoptable pets. We decided to use Foundation for the CSS framework. Javascript is used to connect the APIs and interactivity across the frontend. 

We learned that it takes a team to complete something like this in a short period of time. We had to work together to get things ironed out between our group and also ensure that this project would be useful/functional.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
